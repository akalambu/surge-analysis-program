  RESULTS OF ANALYSIS

  NOTES:
  1.Where moderate to extensive occurrence of vapour pressure
    is indicated by analysis, the results are to be treated 
    as of qualitative value only.
  2.Where air valves/air cusion valves are used as vacuum breaker
    the results are to be treated as approximate.
  3.The User Manual may be referred for more details regarding
    limitations of analysis and for preparing results in
    graphical form.
